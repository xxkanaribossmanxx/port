 <h1>BUSINESS ADVICE</h1>
 <p class="tekstboks">
  every single time a businesss hired me as their salesman profits immediately went up by 500%.
  you know how, is it because i'm charismatic sure that's part of it, is it because i show the customers
  Pictures of their Family and where they live Yeah that helps as well. honesty and the quality of the
  deal that established With the customers is what really matters, they get to walk away With a great
  produckt and as a bonus, they get to keep their limbs. my mentor used to tell me all the time if a 
  customers ever tries to negotiate a better deal, you should immedietly threaten their life.
  
  in every business you have the top 1% that makes more Money then everybody else, let me give you an 
  exampel let's say Your a mortician, you bury People for a living you set up funerals, wait for People to 
  die hopefully you can make 30 grand a year. the 1% mortician goes every School in his neighbohood,
  finds the most depressed kids and hands each one of them a AK-47, two weeks later you got enough 
  Money to retire for the rest of your life.

 <h1>MY STORY</h1>
 <p class="tekstboks2">
  20 years ago this guy in a wheelchair came up to me while i was running apparently it was a veteran,
  he's talking about me being his biggest inspiration and all this, i looked at him Down there and told him
  hey man, stop being a Coward, stop being a lazy cripple, lose the wheelchair and start running With me
  right now, of course he wouldn't do it, so i took his wheelchair and i left his ass crawling back home like
  the Coward that he is. don't let weak minded People like this bring you Down to their Level. so i was in somebody's
  funeral the other day a Family member of mine, so you know the whole thing everybody crying and stuff, they were
  telling me to stop doing push-ups during the burial because it's disrespectful screw that, i'm not that soft shit, i did
  squats on top of that motherfriking's grave Meanwhile everybody was looking, should have seen their feces.
